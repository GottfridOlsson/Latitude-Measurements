From 2022-01-06: measurements with PMAS version Beta. with 2mm hole caps (varepsilon < 0.25 deg).
From 2022-02-23 onwards: measured with PMAS version Beta both ways and took the mean angle (but stopped when I saw it gave the same results)
From 2022-08-13 onwards: the plumb is no longer a hex-nut but a gifted brass piece from Alfred Wäpling :)
